MateSolver can be used to mateSearch chess positions.
 There are two modes: "Analysis mode" and "Mate search".<br>
<br>
<h3>Modes</h3>
In "Analysis mode" you can play moves based on a legal position,
 where white is always considered moving first.<br>
In mode "Mate search" you can set up a legal position and
 let the app search for a checkmate in a given number of
 moves, where white is also considered moving first
 (e.g. White mates in 2 moves).<br>
Switching between both modes will preserve the position.
 Switching to "Analysis mode" will set white to move and
 the number of current move to 1. A calculated mate will
 be erased from the text area. Switching to mode
 "Mate search" will erase all moves of "Analysis mode"
 from the text area.<br>
<br>
<h3>Setting up board/Moving</h3>
To set up a legal position, you must be in mode "Mate search".
 In "Analysis mode" you can only reset the board to the initial
 position (which is legal). When you switch to "Analysis mode"
 after having set up a non legal position, you will be noticed
 about the invalid position in the text area and no moves will
 be accepted. The same will happen in mode "Mate search", if
 you try to let the app search for checkmate from a non
 legal position.<br>
Setting up the board or moving is done by tapping the square
 you want to move from (it is selected) and tapping the square
 you want to move to afterwards. In mode "Mate search"
 you can use the "pieces area" right of the board to get pieces
 from and to remove pieces to (no matter which was selected).
 If you tap to move to a square containing a piece, it will be
 substituted. If you tap a selected square or a non legal one,
 the selection is canceled.<br>

<h3>The app's menu</h3>
<b>Search mate ("Mate search"):</b><br>
The app will search for a checkmate in a given number of moves
 (white is considered moving first). The number of moves can be
 set up in menu item Options.<br>
<b>Cancel mate search ("Mate search"):</b><br>
Cancel a running mate search.<br>
<b>Clear board ("Mate search"):</b><br>

<b>Copy board (image) to file:</b><br>
The current board will be drawn to a PNG-File and saved into
 "sdcard"/Android/data/de.streblow.matesolver/Files/MateSolveryyyyMMdd_HHmm.png<br>
<b>Copy board (text) to clipboard:</b><br>
The current board will be copied line by line to the clipboard
 as unicode text with chess figurines separated by spaces.<br>
<b>Copy text to clipboard:</b><br>
The content of the text area will be copied to the clipboard.<br>
<b>Options:</b><br>
Chose the number of moves the "Mate search" has to search for a
 checkmate (brute-force).<br>
Keep in mind: a "mate-in-three" is solvable in a reasonable amount
 of time, a "mate-in-4" can last very long depending on the number
 of possible moves! Thats why the number of moves is limited to
 maximal 6 moves.<br>
Check the option "First move only" if
 you want to see the initial move/moves for the solution only.<br>
